_Email from Jean_:

Thank you all for a great meeting today.

Please find attached, the following:


1. Our DRAFT of the grant application. Especially see green highlights, where I need your help. 
2. EPA/NIH papers (3) that did comparisons of different fibers, based on equal mass exposures in rats. I do not like how they did their data analysis to come up with their conclusions about relative fiber toxicity, since it is all based on equal mass. See big tables for the type of data provided from the electron microscopes (SEM and TEM).

3. One paper (asbestos_FiberSize) on the debate re: short vs long fibers, just to give you an idea about how hypothesis, since very small fibers (< 5 microns in length) are typically disregarded.

4. Example data. One Excel file shows ANA data (pos/neg, and titers), and the other shows a continuous variable for collagen. I hope these help!

5. Our poster from the Research Day last month, just as a summary of what we did for preliminary data.

Let me know if/when you have questions!

Thank you SO much!

Jean
